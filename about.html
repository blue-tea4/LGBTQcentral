    <p>This site is a project I have worked on in hopes of educating people about the LGBTQ+ comunity. One of the biggest factors I see in discrimination against us is lack of education. People will say insesitive things because they dont know any better. Or only view the LGBTQ+ through steryotypes from the media. I know that education wont compleatly stop homphobia. But if this site stops just one person from saying something hurtful due to ignorance then my goal is compleat. Please try to educate yourself beyond this website. Talking to people is a greast way to start. Everyone has their own unique experience if they want to share. </p>

    <p> Remember that it is still okay to make mistakes. When you do though you need to be able to listen and try to understand the impact and how to avoid it in the future. Always ask questions and keep learning. That is what being an ally is.
